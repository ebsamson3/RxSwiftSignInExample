## **About**

A simple, unstylized project for the purpose of learning how to combine MVVM + Coordinators + RxSwift

In this project RxSwift is used to:

- Validate form input text fields & update UI accordingly
- Create table views with reduced boilerplate code compared to delegate methods
- Reposition text fields in response to keyboard appearance/disappearance
- Manage user authorization status changes
- Manage memory of child coordinators
- Trigger app navigation events
- Trigger error handling

## **Installation**

In the project directory run

```
pod install
```

Then open and run the `RxSwiftSignInExample.workspace`
